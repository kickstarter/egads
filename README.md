# egads: Extensible Git-Archive Deploy Strategy

## Installation

For local work (building and uploading tarballs), put `egads` in your Gemfile:

    # In Gemfile
    gem 'egads'

On remote machines (to which you deploy), `egads` must be in your PATH.
So install `egads` as a system gem:

    sudo gem install egads
